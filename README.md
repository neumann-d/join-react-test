# Candidate Application & Score Calculator
![JOIN React Test](https://i.imgur.com/msT4Blg.png)

## Context

We love to give visual feedback to the recruiters about where their candidate stand in their pipeline.
Proposed solution consists of 2 screens:
1. *The applicant screen* - filling it in will send the application to the server
1. *The candidate list screen* - where all existing and new candidates can be viewed (reflecting input from the previous screen)

This app needs to display the list of candidates taken from this API: GET https://candidates.free.beeceptor.com/api/candidate
(If API is not available, use file located in this repository under /data/candidates.json) and send a local request instead.

## Design
Screens are provided in /data folder for reference, it doesn't have to look identical, just a visual reference, you can use Material or Bootstrap for UI components

## Requirements
As a Candidate:
- [ ] I want to be able to provide my data in application form without any field being required
- [ ] *[OPTIONAL]* I want to be able to upload my photo

As a Recruiter:
- [ ] I want to be able to view a list of my candidates
- [ ] For each application calculate score:
  - Up to 10% if full name provided
  - 10% if email provided
  - 10% if password provided
  - 20% if phone provided
  - *[OPTIONAL]* 50% if image uploaded (calculate accordingly if implemented or not)
- [ ] I want by clicking on the "..." menu, be able to "delete" the candidate (hide from display)
- [ ] I want by clicking on the "..." menu, be able to change candidate state from "submitted" to "in review" to either "not a fit" or "hired"
  
## Technical Notes
There's no restriction to backend technology, you can e.g.:
- utilize localStorage for candidate data storage (as your backend) and merge it with existing API data
- spin up a NodeJS server

If the external API is too slow, make sure it's not visible or felt by the user, find a way to make load/wait time a pleasure.

## Tech Stack
Use ReactJS with TypeScript, test your code with a preferred library of your choice, also feel free to choose either unit tests or E2E tests with Cypress
Linter, CSSinJS is a plus

## Instructions

- Fork this repo
- Commit early and often. We want to be able to check your way of thinking
- Make the app public. Deploy it using the service of your choice (ZEIT, Cloud Run, Heroku)
- Create a pull request

## Disclaimer
You don't have to finish all of that, but we would really love to see a working piece.
What's more important for us is to see your way of thinking and priority on tasks during implementation!

## Solution

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
